# Laboratory Work â„–5: Clustering with Supervised Machine Learning  

This project demonstrates the implementation of clustering algorithms using Fisher's Iris dataset. It focuses on two popular methods: **K-Means** and **Affinity Propagation**.

## **Overview**  

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning approach to group similar data points into clusters. Unlike classification, it does not require labeled data. This project implements:  
1. **K-Means Clustering**: Groups data into a pre-defined number of clusters.  
2. **Affinity Propagation**: Clusters data points based on their similarity without pre-defining the number of clusters.

## **Objectives**  

- Explore clustering techniques for pattern discovery.
- Identify optimal clusters using evaluation metrics.
- Visualize results with methods like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

## **Setup Instructions**  

### **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.x  
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

### **Installation**  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
